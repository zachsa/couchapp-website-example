                    <h3>But why?</h3>
                    <p>What is a twirp you might ask? A twirp is simply an unwelcome digital intrusion in your daily life, much like a Facebook push notification. It is derived from the word ‘tweet’.</p>

                    <h3>But what?</h3>
                    <p>The point of this blog is a testing ground as well as a store of the bits and pieces of knowledge I have collected en route to getting old and dying. This website is served specifically using technologies I have been exposed to (so I don't forget them) and will discuss things that are cool - such as my music and photography. Think of this website as the egotistical outlet of someone but-so-humble in person ;).</p>
